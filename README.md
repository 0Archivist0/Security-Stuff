# Security-Stuff
This is a repo for the cyber-security stuff I may either make, learn, use, ect.
I have some scripts in here that do verious things such as check for users and ssh connections 
that I use for checking my system which is debian based

There is a script that was specifically for a malware, but I just whiped the system and Installed a new OS so, its development is kinda abandonded....
